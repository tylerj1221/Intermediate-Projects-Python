# Intermediate Python Projects

Welcome to my Intermediate Python Projects repository! üéâ This repository features two exciting projects that showcase the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Python logic skills. Dive in and explore!

## Projects

### ‚òï OOP Coffee Machine
The **OOP Coffee Machine** is a Python-based application that simulates the functionality of a coffee vending machine. It's built using Object-Oriented Programming principles and provides the following features:
- Menu of coffee options (e.g., Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).
- Ingredient tracking (e.g., water, coffee, milk supply).
- Payment system to calculate costs and accept payments.
- Interactive interface with clear user prompts.

Whether you're craving a virtual coffee or looking for an OOP demo, this project delivers!

### ‚ùì True/False Quiz
The **True/False Quiz** tests your knowledge while implementing Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and more! Features include:
- A series of true/false questions sourced from trivia databases or defined in the code.
- Score tracking for correct and incorrect answers.
- User-friendly feedback to enhance the quiz experience.

Challenge your mind and test your Python skills with this interactive quiz project!
